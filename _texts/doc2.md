Dr. J. Freeman Pyle, Dean of the  
College of Business and Public Ad­  
ministration, was appointed recently  
to serve as a member and consultant  
of the Maryland Commission on Post-  
War Development and Reconstruc­  
tion, set up in Baltimore last summer  
by Governor O’Connor.  
When Dean Pyle was appointed by  
the governor, he was made a member  
of two of the four committees, the  
Committee on Public Activities and  
the one on Fiscal and Legal Prob­  
lems; the former committee is doing  
some studying on problems concern­  
ing post-war public construction to be  
carried on by the state. The com­  
mittees report to the commission,  
which in turn reports to the Board  
of Public Works, working in con­  
junction with the State Planning  
Commission.  
Other members of the commission  
include Glen Martin of the Martin  
Airplane Company, Roy Barton  
White, President of the Baltimore  
and Ohio Railroad, E. Brooks Lee,  
member of Maryland-National Park  
Commission, and L. Harold Sothoron,  
Senator from Prince Georges County.  
The commission is set up at present  
to function for two years.
